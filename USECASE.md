# The Solution:

•	Use DNA Center Terraform provider to facilitate the declarative configuration of Cisco DNA Center.

# The Results:

•	Expedite DNA Center deployments
•	Increased accuracy and site design standardization

# Business Summary:

Simplify the Site creation with automation tooling based on Terraform and Cisco DNA Center REST APIs.
